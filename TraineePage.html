                    <p style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: large;">Hello, my name is Hugo, I am a trainee front-end website developer at Hot Beans Web. I have been working at the company for over three months now, and so far i have had a great experience with working at this company as all my colleagues are polite and welcoming as well as very cooperative. The moment I joined 
                    the company's workforce, I was immediately given a warm welcome by all the crew members, this allowed me to get settled in really quickly. I am really enjoying working as a front-end developer as it also allows me to showcase my art skills and use my creative mind. I've always anjoyed art from when I was in primary school, and I finally have the opportunity to use those art skills for working purposes, it is always best to take on a career which involves something that you enoy doing.  </p>

                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">My name is Jivan, and I am a trainee website tester for Hot Beans Web. On my first day at Hot Beans, I was immediately welcomed by all of my colleagues, this made things better for me, as I felt a sense of belonging when I joined the crew, this also allowed me to get settled within no time. People at the company are very friendly and they do not judge you based on whether you have a different background or anything along those lines,
                    everyone working at the company gets treated equally, and I believe this should be the case for every other company that exists on this planet. I have the responsibility to test our websites to ensure that they function properly, by checking for any imperfections on the websites. I look through all web pages of a finished website to see if the content on all web pages meet the demands of the client as well as check whether certain elements such as links
                    direct the users to the correct web page.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Hello, this is Owen Collins, one of the company's trainee back-end website developers. My experiences with the company and my colleagues were similar to my other two trainee colleagues Jivan and Hugo, I was greeted with a warm welcome soon after I joined and I managed to make quite a lot of new friends upon joining the company's workforce. My role is to ensure that our websites are 100% safe for users to interact with as well as input their data when making online transactions or creating accounts, as some of our websites are also created for small online retailers, so therefore it is important to ensure the confidentiality of user's personal details to prevent those details from being leaked or exploited.</p>
