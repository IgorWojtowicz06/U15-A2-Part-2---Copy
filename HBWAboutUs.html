                    <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Greetings user, my name is Harris, I am one of the company's front-end developers. As a front-end developer, my main responsibility is to construct the visual elements of a website, such elements which your are seeing right now on your screen, I am in charge of adding content on websites such as imagery, text and even interactive content such as scroll animations and interactive slideshows. In my opinion, I believe that being a front-end developer is a relatively fun job to have as it involves
                        using your own creativity and imagination, it is sort of like creating digital art which is informative with the inclusion of text. Think of it as drawing a website design from the top of your head on paper then applying it on the computer screen, although drawing the website on paper would be much easier than creating one using coding oftware such as visual studio code, you have to make sure you know what each specific tag does as well as understand different coding languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I think you should have little to no problem with creating websites using these languages.

While some of my colleagues such as Harris, who are in charge of constructing the visual elements of websites, I am in charge of optimising the security of all of the websites we make for our clients so that our websites are entirely safe for users to interact with, this is to ensure that the crucial data of those who use our websites are protected at all times from cyberattacks, especially when it comes to performing certain tasks such as transactions, it is important to ensure that all of the payment details entered by users is confidential to protect this specific type of information from potential exploitations. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Arial';">Hello, my name is Jenson Clarke, I am responsible for ensuring that our websites work perfectly according to the client and user needs by testing the functionality of all of our websites. I check for any imperfections and provide my colleagues who are in charge of designing the websites with feedback on what must be done to improve the performance of the website and to fulfil all the tasks necessary to satisfy our client's needs. I carefully go through all of the web pages on a website, I also check to see if the visual elements on the website are suitable to the user's perspective by assessing the suitability of fonts used on the websites, the suitability of the colours used and by assessing how well all visual elements are presented on the website to ensure that the website's design does not overwhelm the users and that all of the information displayed on the websites is intuitively readable to the user's perspective. </p>
